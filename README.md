Here is about 5 Numpy functions that could be very helpful .

Numpy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It's one of the most used library for data processing in many field such as Data scientist, Data engineering, Data analysis. With Numpy, developers can do the following :

Array arithmetic and logical operations.
Fourier transfroms and routines for graph manipulation.
operations related to linear algebra(Numpy has built-in functions for linear algebra and random number generation).
Numpy is commonly used with SciPy(Scientific Python) and Matplolib(drawing library).This combination is widely used as an alternative to Matlab(a popular technical computing platform). Python is now considered as a more modern and complete programming language by many expert. In this article we are going to discuss about 5 interesting Numpy array functions such as:

- np.reshape()
- np.allclose()
- np.where()
- np.clip()
- np.einsum()

The recommended way to run this notebook is to click the "Run" button at the top of this page, and select "Run on Binder". This will run the notebook on mybinder.org, a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks.
